ButlerBoard is an auction-based marketplace for small tasks, odd jobs, errands and everything in between. This site is beta now.

I worked with team in Sunbytes VietNam from August 2012 to August 2013 to develop this project. We use Zend Framework to build the main site and use Wordpress to make a corporate site. And we build an own library for this project also.
