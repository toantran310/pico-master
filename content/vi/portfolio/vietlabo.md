Vietlabo.com is one of the largest recruitment websites in VietNam, has reached over 1000 candidates registered and new jobs updated everyday. It help users find out the right talent needed and good job needed.

This website is based on the newest Zend Framework, when I build it, I and my partner build a team’s module base on ZendFramework 2 so it’s more suitable for team to build projects with a cool backend very fast and more flexible to code.
